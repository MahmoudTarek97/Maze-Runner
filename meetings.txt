- character ----> what will be in weapon interface ?
                  add decorator to runner and monster
                  implement factory for runner and monster
- levels -------> mapCells counts problem
                  treat with mapCell name instead of class
* how can we diffrentiate between bulleftGifgt & healthGift & scoreGift and so on?
we need this differentiation to implement generation logic and set count logic for mapCells
Brainstorming to find a solution for this problem
- a suggestion : Contract --static
- another one : map simulation to check if it is valid --optimal way may make the map invalid --we will discart alot of valid maps (time)
- another one : simulation after generation and make the map valid (put gifts) --hard to implement
- another one : runtime --harder
- the solution : add method isCauseDamage in mapCell and add method getRandomGift in mapCell Factory
                 the generation will be splitted into 3 phases
                 
				 1- generate nonDestroyables Walls & ways
                 1- generate Bombs randlomly
                 2- generate destroysObstaclesGifts
                 3- generate notDestroysObstaclesGifts
