- character ----> what will be in weapon interface ?
                  add decorator to runner and monster
                  implement factory for runner and monster
- levels -------> mapCells counts problem
                  treat with mapCell name instead of class
* how can we diffrentiate between bulleftGifgt & healthGift & scoreGift and so on?
we need this differentiation to implement generation logic and set count logic for mapCells
Brainstorming to find a solution for this problem
- a suggestion : Contract --static
- another one : map simulation to check if it is valid --optimal way may make the map invalid --we will discart alot of valid maps (time)
- another one : simulation after generation and make the map valid (put gifts) --hard to implement
- another one : runtime --harder
- the solution : add method isCauseDamage in mapCell and add method getRandomGift in mapCell Factory
                 the generation will be splitted into 4 phases
                 
				 1- generate nonDestroyables Walls & Ways
                 2- generate Obstacles randlomly
                 3- generate destroysObstaclesGifts
                 4- generate notDestroysObstaclesGifts

1- Position 
 	a) abdelrahman : implement two methods in mapCell (get and set Position)
 	b) shazly : use set position while generating the map 
 	c) Controller : on updating any mapcell a boolean is returned . this boolean denotes if there is a new mapcell
 					or not . so if this boolen is true then you get the the new mapcell from getupdated method .
 					HHHHere we shold use the getter of the position . to know where to put that returned cell 
2-labib - - - >  runner movement                   --hwa katb kda
3- separate runner from monster
4- change the name Obstacle to Bomb 
5- we need to learn javaFX (wee need to talk)
6- shazly - - - > set object at runtime (mapcell)  --hwa katb kda
